contentful
==========

Provides integrations with Contentful APIs (Delivery and Preview) for PHP 5.6+.

There is an official Contentful PHP SDK now ([contentful/contentful](https://packagist.org/packages/contentful/contentful)) - so use what makes sense for you. This package has been in large-scale production for over two years now, and I am focusing on making it the fastest client available for fetching Contentful data.

Previous aspirations to integrate with Contentful's Content Management API are now dropped - please look to Contentful to support that.

Documentation
-------------

I know this is sorely missing - _mea culpa_. Docs will be forthcoming.
